# WojtusDiscord
## A Discord bot with little to no purpose

This project's purpose is to act as a snadbox to play around with microservices concepts and tools, as well as being my main portfolio project

Many features and tools, as well as design decisions, are driven primarly by my desire to learn them, without much regard for what would be actually reasonable to use here

Consider this project, alongside my blog, as a demo of my knowledge about designing microservice systems, implementing specific technologies, thought process, and overall skill profile

## FAQ

  - Q: Why did you used X instead of Y? Isn't it a overkill here?\
    A: As stated in the introduction, choice of every tool/tech/lib used is mainly my desire to learn this specific tool, although my decision might've been explained in my blog posts
